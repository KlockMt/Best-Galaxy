# Best-Galaxy
A shell script for a better user experience on Samsung Galaxy and other phones.

If you want to change your device's configuration easily and without issues, try this script for Galaxy devices and others.

Instructions:

For PC: Connect your device, then copy and paste the commands from the /C&P-on-aShell-or-PC/ file into your terminal.

For Mobile: To do the same thing using only your phone, copy and paste the commands from the /C&P-on-aShell-or-PC/ file into a terminal app (like aShell).
